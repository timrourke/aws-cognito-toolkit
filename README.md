## In alpha

Development of this library is still in progress. Contributions are welcome and
encouraged.

## Goals

[AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) is a very robust (and complicated)
product that provides a user identity and authentication framework. However, its
documentation is a little challenging to digest, and there aren't a ton of great
examples in the wild for how to integrate this service into a PHP application.
The goal of this project is to provide a few framework-agnostic tools to make it
a little easier to work with AWS Cognito, and the JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) it issues.

This library seeks to provide:

- [ ] A PSR-15 middleware for authenticating HTTP requests bearing a JWT issued by AWS Cognito
- [ ] A factory to build a PSR-7 response in the event of an unauthenticated request
- [ ] A keychain service for fetching and caching the public RSA keyset for your AWS Cognito User Pool
- [ ] Several HTTP services useful for initiating authentication and user management flows in an AWS Cognito User Pool
